    "Hello! My name is Jakob Sautter and I am a Senior Software Engineer based in Berlin/Vienna with 10+ years of professional experience designing, developing, and implementing enterprise web-applications and software analytics solutions. I am specifically interested in backend development, designing service architectures, creating APIs and working with databases.",
    "I have a strong academic background in software engineering and hold a BSc and MSc degree. Before that I studied sociology which reflects my desire to look at things from very different perspectives.",
    "My interests span modern distributed services architecture and generative/meta programming as well as technology-society-discourses and pop culture. In my spare time, I enjoy spending time with my wife, playing Nintendo games from the late 90s (and lately some more current ones) and going out to dinner with my friends."
